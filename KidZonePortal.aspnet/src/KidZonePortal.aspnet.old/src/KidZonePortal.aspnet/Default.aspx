    <h2>
        Welcome to Kid Zone Portal!</h2>
    <p>
        This website was created to provide a safe browsing experience for children.&nbsp; 
        Parents must approve any content that is viewed through this website.&nbsp; 
        Parents and Children have their own login accounts.&nbsp; Notifications will be 
        sent to Parent&#39;s website mailbox or external mailbox in order to grant access to 
        content requests by their children.&nbsp; Parents will also need to grant access 
        to allow their children to be able to receive notifications from or chat with 
        other users of the site.&nbsp; Children can upload content to their own space 
        but in order to share that content with others will also require parent 
        approval.&nbsp; We try to filter out any content submissions that are deemed to 
        contain material that is unsuitable for Children.&nbsp; If any unsuitable 
        material or behavior by any other users is concerning you please contact
        <a href="mailto:dotnetgirl@hotmail.com">dotnetgirl@hotmail.com</a> for 
        assistance and removal of Users and/or content from the site.</p>
    <p>
        The Kid Zone Portal has some content that is deemed safe to be added to each 
        Child&#39;s library but that content still needs to be approved by the Parent.&nbsp; 
        The parent can see everything that their child can see when their child logs on, 
        but additionally the parent can administer to the visibility and access to each 
        content item or &quot;friends&quot;.</p>
